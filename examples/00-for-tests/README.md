Certainly! Below is a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Go (Golang):
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")}
```

### Explanation:
- `package main`: Every standalone Go program must have a package named `main`. The package `main` indicates that this is an executable application.
- `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `fmt` package which provides functions for formatted I/O. Specifically, we use it to print our message.
- `func main() {...}`: The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. When you run the Go program, execution starts from this function.
- `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output (the console).

To run this program:
1. Save the code into a file with a `.go` extension, e.g., `hello.go`.
2. Run it using the Go command-line tool:
```sh
go run hello.go
```

This will compile and execute the program, and you should see the output:```Hello, World!```
